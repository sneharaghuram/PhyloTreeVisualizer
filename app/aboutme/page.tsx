        Hi! Thanks for checking out my web application! 
        I'm a recent Computer Science graduate from UCLA that works in Technology Consulting.
        This project idea came to me after I read David Reich's "Who We Are and How We Got Here."
        I've always been fascinated by Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and wanted to create a project
        that would combine my interest with skills I learned in my degree.
